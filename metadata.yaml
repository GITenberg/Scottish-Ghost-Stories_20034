description: Wraiths, wirry-cows, goblins -- the folklore of Scotland is teeming with
  supernatural beings, haunted houses, spirits, and other spooky creatures, and in
  this volume, writer and researcher Elliott O'Donnell collects some of the best-known
  tales about them. Known for publishing many book-length studies of supernatural
  occurrences throughout the United Kingdom, O'Donnell's take on the subject is detailed
  and engaging.
